Conditional execution
 if sheep_counter >= 120:
    make_a_bed()
    take_a_shower()
    sleep_and_dream()
feed_the_sheepdogs()
Now we know what we'll do if the conditions are met, and we know what we'll do if not everything goes our way. In other words, we have a "Plan B".

Python allows us to express such alternative plans. This is done with a second, slightly more complex form of the conditional statement, the if-else statement:
if true_or_false_condition:
    perform_if_condition_true
else:
    perform_if_condition_false

if the_weather_is_good:
    go_for_a_walk()
else:
    go_to_a_theater()
have_lunch()
If the weather is good, we'll go for a walk. Otherwise, we'll go to a theater. No matter if the weather is good or bad, we'll have lunch afterwards (after the walk or after going to the theater).
Everything we've said about indentation works in the same manner inside the else branch:
if the_weather_is_good:
    if nice_restaurant_is_found:
        have_lunch()
    else:
        eat_a_sandwich()
else:
    if tickets_are_available:
        go_to_the_theater()
    else:
        go_shopping()

Choosing Larger Number
# Read two numbers
number1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
 # Choose the larger number
if number1 > number2:
    larger_number = number1
else:
    larger_number = number2
 # Print the result
print("The larger number is:", larger_number)

#largest_number = -999999999
number = int(input())
if number == -1:
    print(largest_number)
    exit()
if number > largest_number:
    largest_number = number
# Go to line 02

number1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
number3 = int(input("Enter the third number: "))
 # Check which one of the numbers is the greatest
# and pass it to the largest_number variable.
 largest_number = max(number1, number2, number3)
 
# Print the result.
print("The largest number is:", largest_number)
By the same fashion, you can use the min() function to return the lowest number. You can rebuild the above code and experiment with it in the Sandbox.
Calculate Income Tax
income = float(input("Enter the annual income: "))
if income < 85528:
	tax = income * 0.18 - 556.02
# Write the rest of your code here.
tax = round(tax, 0)
print("The tax is:", tax, "thalers")
